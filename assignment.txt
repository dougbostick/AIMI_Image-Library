│ ├── scss/
│ │ └── styles.scss
│ └── index.html

├── dist/
│ ├── css/
│ │ └── styles.css

├── package.json
└── Gruntfile.js

Remember to include a .gitignore file in your project to avoid uploading node_modules and other non-essential files.
Ensure your repository is public and includes a README.md with instructions on how to run your project.
